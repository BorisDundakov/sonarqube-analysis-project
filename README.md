# sonarqube-analysis-project
This project is solely created for analysis test configuration purposes only

Note: The organization's webhook url needs to be updated everytime ngrok is stopped, because it changes it's IP address

ngrok maps local ip (localhost:9000 --> Sonarqube container) to ngrok webhook (https://some-numbers-here.eu.ngrok.io)
